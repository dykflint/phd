	abstract = {Computations of locations of nuclei and movement of electrons within molecules and materials are widely used in science and technology. Direct computation of a system{\textquoteright}s wave function for that purpose becomes impractical as system size grows. Current alternative methods can have difficulty with strongly correlated electron motion or spurious electron self-interaction. By using {\textquotedblleft}natural spin-orbitals{\textquotedblright} to describe the motion of individual electrons, solving for them together with their joint and individual probabilities of occurrence within the system, we are able to account better for electron correlation when strong while avoiding self-interaction and maintaining the growth of computation cost with system size at the level of Hartree{\textendash}Fock theory. Our numerical results for some small test molecules are very good.We introduce an energy functional for ground-state electronic structure calculations. Its variables are the natural spin-orbitals of singlet many-body wave functions and their joint occupation probabilities deriving from controlled approximations to the two-particle density matrix that yield algebraic scaling in general, and Hartree{\textendash}Fock scaling in its seniority-zero version. Results from the latter version for small molecular systems are compared with those of highly accurate quantum-chemical computations. The energies lie above full configuration interaction calculations, close to doubly occupied configuration interaction calculations. Their accuracy is considerably greater than that obtained from current density-functional theory approximations and from current functionals of the one-particle density matrix.},

The electronic structure in 1–9 was analyzed with charge- and energy-partitioning methods. The results show that the bonding situations in L2C compounds 1–8 can be interpreted in terms of donor–acceptor interactions between closed-shell ligands L and a carbon atom which has two lone-pair orbitals L→C←L. This holds particularly for the carbodiphosphoranes 1–3 where L=PR3, which therefore are classified as divalent carbon(0) compounds. The NBO analysis suggests that the best Lewis structures for the carbodicarbenes 6 and 7 where L is a NHC ligand have CCC double bonds as in the tetraaminoallene 8. However, the Lewis structures of 6–8, in which two lone-pair orbitals at the central carbon atom are enforced, have only a slightly higher residual density. Visual inspection of the frontier orbitals of the latter species reveals their pronounced lone-pair character, which suggests that even the quasi-linear tetraaminoallene 8 is a “masked” divalent carbon(0) compound. This explains the very shallow bending potential of 8. The same conclusion is drawn for phosphoranylketene 4 and for carbon suboxide (5), which according to the bonding analysis have hidden double-lone-pair character. The AIM analysis and the EDA calculations support the assignment of carbodiphosphoranes as divalent carbon(0) compounds, while NHC 9 is characterized as a divalent carbon(II) compound. The L→C(1D) donor–acceptor bonds are roughly twice as strong as the respective L→BH3 bond.},

The equilibrium structure of the molecule was found to be bent, with a barrier to linearity of only 18 cm−1.

The vibrational energy levels and effective rotational constants determined for various ν7 states were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data."

The spectrum was recorded with a Bomem interferometer at a resolution of about 0.004 cm−1; after deconvolution a resolution of about 0.002 cm−1 was attained. Seven bands were identified and assigned to rovibrational transitions of 12C316O2. These consist of the ν6 fundamental band and some of the hot bands associated with the ν7, 2ν7, and 3ν7 states. The data obtained on the ν6 + nν7 states were used as input for a semirigid bender fit yielding the effective CCC bending potential energy function in the ν6 state together with a number of related parameters. From the results of the present work together with the results of previous semirigid bender fits it was found that C3O2 is bent at equilibrium with an equilibrium CCC bond angle of 156° and a barrier to linearity of 28 cm−1."

This approach bears strong resemblance to certain methods already in use: in implementation it is much like the LDA+U method with the important distinction that it is parameter-free; in concept has much in common with previous ‘exact exchange’ and self-interaction corrected approaches. The EECE method is applied to several systems with varying correlation strengths and characters (FeF2, NiO, hcp Gd, FeAl) and the results are compared with those obtained by LDA +U and Hartree–Fock methods as well as results within the local spin density and generalized gradient approximations to density functional theory.

balanced crystal orbital overlap population (BCOOP) is an energy resolved quantity which
is positive for bonding states and negative for antibonding states, hence enabling a
distinction between bonding and antibonding contributions to the chemical bond.
Unlike the conventional crystal orbital overlap population (COOP), BCOOP
handles correctly the situation of crystal orbitals being nearly linear dependent,
which is often the case in the solid state. Also, BCOOP is much less basis set
dependent than COOP. A BCOOP implementation within the full-potential linear
muffin tin orbital method is presented and illustrated for Si, TiC and Ru. Thus,
BCOOP is compared to the COOP and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP)
for systems with chemical bonds ranging from metallic to covalent character.}

A special attention is paid to the use of the liquid-phase-exfoliated graphene and multilayer graphene as the fillers in the thermal interface materials. It has been demonstrated that addition of an optimized mixture of graphene and multilayer graphene to the composites with different matrix materials produces the record-high enhancement of the effective thermal conductivity at the small filler loading fraction (f≤10vol%). The thermal conductivity enhancement due to the presence of graphene in the composites has been observed for a range of matrix materials used by industry. The hybrid composites where graphene is utilized together with metallic micro- and nanoparticles allow one to tune both the thermal and electrical conductivity of these materials. Theoretical considerations indicate that the graphene-based thermal interface materials can outperform those with carbon nanotubes, metal nanoparticles and other fillers owing to graphene’s geometry, mechanical flexibility and lower Kapitza resistance at the graphene–base material interface."

abstract = "As one of the most appealing and attractive technologies, heterogeneous photocatalysis has been utilized to directly harvest, convert and store renewable solar energy for producing sustainable and green solar fuels and a broad range of environmental applications. Due to their unique physicochemical, optical and electrical properties, a wide variety of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts have been designed to drive various reduction and oxidation reactions under light irradiation with suitable wavelengths. In this review, we have systematically summarized the photocatalytic fundamentals of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, including fundamental mechanism of heterogeneous photocatalysis, advantages, challenges and the design considerations of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. The versatile properties of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are highlighted, including their crystal structural, surface phisicochemical, stability, optical, adsorption, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and electronic properties. Various design strategies are also thoroughly reviewed, including band-gap engineering, defect control, dimensionality tuning, pore texture tailoring, surface sensitization, heterojunction construction, co-catalyst and nanocarbon loading. Many important applications are also addressed, such as photocatalytic water splitting (H2 evolution and overall water splitting), degradation of pollutants, carbon dioxide reduction, selective organic transformations and disinfection. Through reviewing the important state-of-the-art advances on this topic, it may provide new opportunities for designing and constructing highly effective g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for various applications in photocatalysis and other related fields, such as solar cell, photoelectrocatalysis, electrocatalysis, lithium battery, supercapacitor, fuel cell and separation and purification."

The formation of these nanosheets was confirmed by the AFM, XRD, FESEM and FTIR analyses. These nanosheets subsequently were transformed to carboxyl-rich nano structures through hydrothermal oxidation and were characterized by XRD, AFM, DRS, FESEM, Zeta-potential and FTIR. AFM studies revealed that the thickness and lateral size of these nano structures were 6 and 35–50nm, respectively. In the present work, carboxyl-rich g-C3N4 was used as a selective sensor for detection of Hg2+ and Fe3+ which showed 12 and 190nM detection limits, respectively. In addition, CN− was added as a discriminative agent to the aqueous media of these ions that enhanced and quenched PL intensities of Hg2+ and Fe3+, respectively."

The aim of this review is to provide an updated report of the most recent manuscripts (years 2009–2011) regarding the use of CNTs in Separation Science. In particular, the use of CNTs as solid-phase extraction and microextraction sorbents, as part of membranes as well as their use in chromatography and electrophoresis will be discussed and commented. Besides, although not as fully related to Separation Science as the previous techniques, the use of CNTs as laser desorption/ionization substrates has also been considered because of its importance in the field."

    abstract = { At a very early period of the investigation on the action of electricity upon oxygen, which formed the subject of my previous memoir, the idea occurred to me that although but a small and limited proportion of the total oxygen passed through the induction-tube was converted into ozone (which proportion could not be exceeded by any modification I had been able to effect in the conditions of the experiment), it might be practicable to replace that portion of the oxygen which was unaffected by the action of electricity by an indifferent gas, and thus effect the total conversion of oxygen into ozone, or even the actual isolation of the ozone by the subsequent removal of the gas by which it was diluted. Thus, for example, by the passage of 100 cub. centims. of oxygen through the induction-tube, a gas can readily be obtained of which the iodinetitre is 5 cub. centims. This corresponds, according to my previous experiments, to an absorption by hyposulphite of soda of 10 cub. centims. of a gas containing in that space the matter of 15 cub. centims. of oxygen. If, therefore, we were to mix 15 cub. centims. of oxygen with 85 cub. centims. of an indifferent gas which should be unaffected by the action of the electricity, and pass the mixed gases through the induction-tube (assuming the same proportion of ozone to be still formed as in the case of the passage through the tube of pure oxygen), the total amount of oxygen in the gas would be con­verted into ozone, and be removed in that form by passing the gas though a solution of hyposulphite of soda. With the view of testing this idea by a critical experiment, I passed such a mixture of carbonic-acid gas and oxygen through the induction-tube. The formation of ozone was at once apparent, and was rendered evident by the action of the gas issuing from the induction-tube upon a neutral solution of iodide of potassium. But on examining the composition of the gas I soon discovered that the proportion of oxygen in it had actually increased, owing to the decomposition in the induction-tube of the carbonic-acid gas into oxygen and carbonic oxide. I did not publish this experiment; but the apparatus by which it was effected long stood upon my laboratory table, and, together with the results, has repeatedly been explained by me to other chemists. Since that time, as appears from the pages of the 'Comptes Rendus,’ this decomposition of carbonic-acid gas under the influence of electricity has been cited as a novel discovery. So far as the bare fact of the decomposition of carbonic-acid gas, under the influence of electricity, in the induction-tube into oxygen and carbonic oxide is concerned, the results of this experiment might, even at the time it was made by me, have reasonably been anticipated, not only from the circumstance that carbonic-acid gas is, as is well known, decomposed by the passage of the electric spark, but also that Plücker had already observed (although I was unaware of the observation) that when the electric discharge was passed through rarefied carbonic-acid gas, the spectrum of the gas after a short time changed into the spectrum of carbonic oxide, and from this circumstance had inferred the decomposition of the gas. But the observations of this eminent investigator were made under very different circumstances to mine; and he was not cognizant of the forma­tion of ozone, which was the critical point of my experiment, and a result which could not have been ascertained by his method of observation. The experiment having failed in its immediate object was for a time laid aside by me. Subsequently, however, I reverted to it under a somewhat modified form. It occurred to me, instead of mixing oxygen with carbonic acid, to endeavour to generate in the very atmosphere of the carbonic acid itself, by the electric decomposition of the gas, the requisite amount of oxygen. I passed, therefore, pure and dry carbonic acid through the induction-tube, and examined the gases resulting from its decomposition, estimating the ozone by the titre of the gas, and also the oxygen and carbonic oxide formed. This examination at once convinced me of the importance of the experiment in reference to the problem of the isolation of ozone, and became the foundation of the following research, which has gradually been extended in more than one direction. }

abstract = {A new model for calculating electron beam dose has been developed. The algorithm is based on a two- or three-dimensional geometry defined by computerized tomography (CT) images. The Monte Carlo technique was used to solve the electron transport equation. However, in contrast to conventional Monte Carlo models (EGS4) several approximations and simplifications in the description of elementary electron processes were introduced reducing in this manner the computational time by a factor of about 35 without significant loss in accuracy. The Monte Carlo computer program does not need any precalculated data. The random access memory required is about 16 Mbytes for a 1282×50 matrix, depending on the resolution of the CT cube. The Voxel Monte Carlo model (VMC) was tested in comparison to calculations by EGS4 and the “Hogstrom algorithm” (MDAH) using several fictive phantoms. In all cases a good coincidence has been found between EGS4 and VMC, especially near tissue inhomogeneities, whereas the MDAH algorithm has produced dose underestimations of up to 40\%.},
